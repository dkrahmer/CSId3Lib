# CSId3Lib
Library to perform read/write of ID3 tags in MP3 files. Supporting ID3v1,ID3v2.3,ID3V2.4 tags versions.

This code is largely unchanged from [Hugo Rumayor's project located at SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/csid3lib), which has been dormant for several years.

The primary goal of this fork is to migrate to .NET Standard 2.0, then release via NuGet. Future updates will focus on bug fixes, code cleanup and modernizing to C# 7.0 syntax.
