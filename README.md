# CSId3Lib
Library to perform read/write of ID3 tags in MP3 files. Supporting ID3v1,ID3v2.3,ID3V2.4 tags versions.

This code is largely unchanged from Hugo Rumayor's project located at SourceForge, which has been dormant for several years. The goal of this fork is to migrate to .NET Standard and then release via NuGet.
